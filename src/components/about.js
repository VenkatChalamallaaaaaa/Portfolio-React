      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      Hello, my name is Venkat Chalamalla, and I am a third-year student at Vellore of Instituion of Technology. I am currently studying CSE, with an emphasis on Data Science Specialization.

I have always had a passion for exploring and learning. Still, it wasn’t until the junior year that I began to take it seriously. In the past year or so, my skills as Computer Science Major has become more refined and polished. I have been able to apply what I’ve learned in school to help me write more effectively and convey my ideas more clearly.

My goal is to eventually be able to become a Front End Developer as well as a Data Scietist.
